# hubmap-ontology
Repository for creating ontologies for HuBMAP

To create these ontologies, we need code as well as original data. Code and data should have an open-source licenses, e.g. MIT for code and CC-BY for data.

Currently, code is licensed under the MIT License and the data is CC-BY 4.0. Eventually, there should be a curated ontology/release version of the ontology that is CC-BY-ND (No derivatives) that will ensure that there are fixed reference forms of the ontology, which should exist side-by-side with an almost identical one so as to permit the ontology to be remixed and reused as need be.
